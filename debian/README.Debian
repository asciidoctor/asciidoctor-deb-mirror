Since version 2.0.0 of the package the tests have been removed from the gem
by upstream, so we switched to using the github source for fetching the tarball.
But as gem2deb still fetches the gem during the build, the tests are not
injected in the package. As they don't bring anything really to the package
for the end-user, we're fine with that. We just use the tests that are in the
source package in autopkgtest.
